Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Example :
```
Input: 123
Output: 321

Input: -123
Output: -321

Input: 120
Output: 21

Input: 1234567899
Otput: 0
```

Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function `returns 0` when the reversed `integer overflows`.
