Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example:
```
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

## Summary:
Palindrome, Dynamic Programming and String Manipulation. Make sure you understand what a palindrome means. A palindrome is a string which reads the same in both directions. For example, SS = "aba" is a palindrome, SS = "abc" is not.
